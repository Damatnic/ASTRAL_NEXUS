# How to Negotiate Your Salary

## The Problem

Most people leave money on the table because they're uncomfortable negotiating. But salary negotiation isn't just about money—it's about valuing your work and setting yourself up for long-term growth.

## Quick Wins (2 min)

- Research market rates before the conversation
- Practice your pitch out loud (even in front of a mirror)
- Know your walk-away number
- Start with higher than your target (aim high, settle strong)

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Research Market Rates (30 min)

Use these sources to understand your market value:

**Salary Research Tools**:
- Glassdoor (company-specific data)
- PayScale (personalized estimates based on your profile)
- LinkedIn Salary (verified compensation data)
- Levels.fyi (tech roles, total compensation)
- Industry forums and salary surveys

**What to look for**:
- Base salary range for your role
- Total compensation (base + bonus + equity)
- Geographic adjustments (same role, different cities)
- Years of experience correlation

### Step 2: Prepare Your Value Proposition

Document your accomplishments and quantify your impact.

**Template for preparing your pitch**:

```
I've delivered [specific achievement] which resulted in [quantifiable outcome]. 

Specifically, I [action taken] that [impact/result].

This demonstrates my ability to [key skill/value you bring].
```

**Example**:
> Over the past year, I've led the redesign of our customer onboarding process, which reduced time-to-value by 30% and increased customer satisfaction from 7.2 to 8.6 out of 10. This demonstrates my ability to identify process inefficiencies and implement solutions that drive measurable business outcomes.

---

### Step 3: Choose the Right Time

**Best times to negotiate**:
- When you receive a job offer (you have maximum leverage)
- During annual reviews (expected timing)
- When you've recently demonstrated exceptional value
- When you have competing offers

**Worst times to negotiate**:
- Right after a failure or mistake
- When the company is downsizing
- When your role is already in question
- During your first week on the job (wait 6+ months)

---

### Step 4: Frame Your Request

Use collaborative language, not demands.

❌ **Don't say**: "I need $120k to accept this offer."

✅ **Do say**: "Based on my research of market rates for this role and my experience with [specific skills], I was hoping we could discuss a salary in the range of $120-130k. I'm confident I can deliver significant value in this position."

**Why it works**: Positions negotiation as a collaborative discussion rather than an ultimatum.

---

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Responding to a Job Offer Below Market

**Situation**: You receive an offer for $95K, but market rate is $110-120K for your experience level.

**Your Response** (Email or Call):

> Hi [Manager Name],
>
> Thank you so much for the offer—I'm excited about the opportunity to join [Company] and [specific reason why you want to work there].
>
> I've done some research on compensation for this role in [location], and based on my X years of experience with [key skills], I was hoping we could discuss a salary in the range of $115-125K.
>
> I'm confident I can deliver strong value in this position, particularly in [specific area where you excel].
>
> What are your thoughts on finding a number that works for both of us?

**What to expect**: They may counter with $105-110K. This is normal. If you've asked for $115-125K, meeting at $110K is a win.

---

### Scenario 2: Asking for a Raise in Your Current Role

**Situation**: You've been in your role for 2 years with strong performance reviews, but salary hasn't kept pace with market or your contributions.

**Your Preparation**:
1. Document achievements from the past 12 months
2. Research market rate for someone with your experience
3. Calculate the difference between your current salary and market rate
4. Prepare specific examples of impact

**Your Conversation Script**:

> I wanted to schedule time to discuss my compensation. I've been reflecting on my contributions this year—specifically [achievement 1, 2, 3]—and I wanted to align on ensuring my compensation reflects my value to the team.
>
> Based on my research, the market rate for my role and experience level is [range]. I'm currently at [current salary].
>
> I'd like to discuss how we can close that gap. I'm open to creative solutions—whether that's a base salary adjustment, bonus structure, additional equity, or a combination.
>
> What do you think is the best way to move forward?

**Key points**: Come with options, not demands. Show you're a team player.

---

### Scenario 3: Negotiating with Limited Experience

**Situation**: You're early in your career or switching industries, so you don't have extensive accomplishments to point to.

**Your Approach**:
Focus on what you will deliver, not what you have delivered.

**Your Script**:

> I'm really excited about this opportunity. While I understand I'm early in my career, I wanted to discuss compensation.
>
> Based on market research for this role in [location], I see ranges typically starting at [number].
>
> I'm eager to bring [specific skills/qualities] to this role, particularly my ability to [specific capability]. I'm confident I can ramp quickly and start delivering value within [timeframe].
>
> What do you think is fair for someone entering at this level?

**Why it works**: Shows you've done research, demonstrates confidence without arrogance, and invites collaboration.

---

### Scenario 4: They Say "We Don't Negotiate Salaries"

**Their line**: "We have a set salary band and don't negotiate."

**Your response**: Move from base salary to total compensation.

> I understand. Can we discuss the entire compensation package? I'm interested in [some combination of]:
> - Signing bonus
> - Annual bonus structure
> - Equity/stock options
> - Additional vacation days
> - Professional development budget
> - Flexible work arrangements
> - Title adjustment
> - 6-month performance review with raise eligibility

**Why it works**: Many companies have fixed bands for base salary but flexibility elsewhere. If they're truly inflexible, ask about the performance review process and when salary adjustments are possible.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Accepting the First Offer

❌ **Don't**: Accept immediately. Even if it's a good offer, negotiate.

✅ **Do**: Always ask for more. The worst they can say is no, and most companies expect negotiation.

**Why**: Companies typically leave room in their budget for negotiation. If you don't ask, that money stays with them.

---

### Pitfall 2: Taking It Personally

❌ **Don't**: View negotiation as adversarial or get emotional if they push back.

✅ **Do**: Treat it as a business conversation focused on mutual value.

**Why**: Emotion clouds judgment. Stay professional, stay firm on your numbers.

---

### Pitfall 3: Revealing Your Current Salary

❌ **Don't**: Share your current salary if asked (unless legally required in your state).

✅ **Do**: Redirect to market rate and the value you'll bring to the role.

**Your Script**:
> I'm more interested in what's fair for this role and my experience. Based on my research, the market rate for this position is [range]. That's what I'm focused on.

**Why**: Your current salary is irrelevant to your next role's value. Focus on market rate instead.

---

### Pitfall 4: Not Considering Total Compensation

❌ **Don't**: Focus only on base salary.

✅ **Do**: Calculate total compensation (salary + bonus + equity + benefits + time off).

**Example**:
- Offer A: $100K base
- Offer B: $95K base + $10K bonus + $20K equity + 1 extra week vacation

Offer B might be better financially depending on vesting schedules and bonus targets.

## Practice Scenarios

### Exercise 1: Draft Your Value Proposition

Think about 3 specific achievements from the past 12 months. For each, write:

1. **What you did**: [Action taken]
2. **The impact**: [Quantifiable result or outcome]
3. **Why it matters**: [Business value]

**Example**:
- What: Led a cross-functional team to redesign the checkout flow
- Impact: Reduced cart abandonment by 15%, adding $500K annual revenue
- Why it matters: Directly contributes to company's revenue goals and customer experience metrics

---

### Exercise 2: Role-Play Your Conversation

Find a friend or use your phone to record yourself practicing your negotiation pitch.

**Practice saying out loud**:
1. Your opening (expressing excitement)
2. Your research-based ask
3. Your value proposition
4. Handling a "no" or counteroffer
5. Questions you'll ask

You'll be nervous in the real conversation—practice reduces nerves.

---

### Exercise 3: Know Your Walk-Away Number

Ask yourself: **What's the minimum salary I'll accept?**

If they come in below this number and won't budge, you need to be willing to walk away.

Your walk-away number should be based on:
- Your minimum financial needs
- Market rate floor for your role
- Other opportunities available
- Long-term career trajectory

---

## Questions to Ask During Negotiation

**About the role**:
- What does success look like in the first 90 days?
- What are the biggest challenges facing this team?
- What opportunities are there for professional development?

**About compensation**:
- How often do you conduct performance reviews?
- What does the salary progression look like?
- What's the typical bonus payout for someone in this role?
- How does equity vest?

**About the offer**:
- Is this offer negotiable?
- What's your decision timeline for this role?
- Are there other components of compensation we can discuss?

**Red flag responses to salary questions**:
- "We're very competitive with market" (vague, likely not competitive)
- "We'll revisit at your 6-month review" (likely won't happen)
- "Everyone starts at this level" (treats salary as one-size-fits-all)
