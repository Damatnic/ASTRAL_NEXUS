# How to Write Professional Emails

## The Problem

Poorly written emails damage your professional reputation, waste everyone's time, and can derail important projects. Professional email writing is a foundational business skill that many struggle with.

## Quick Wins (2 min)

- Use clear, specific subject lines
- Open with the purpose in the first line
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences max)
- Close with a specific action item or next step

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Craft Your Subject Line

Your subject line determines whether the email gets opened. Make it specific, clear, and actionable.

**Bad**: "Meeting"  
**Good**: "Follow-up: Q4 Strategy Meeting - Next Steps"

**Bad**: "Quick question"  
**Good**: "Budget approval needed for project timeline"

The subject line should answer: What is this about? Why should I care?

---

### Step 2: Start with the "Point"

Open with your main point or request in the first sentence. People skim emails‚Äîdon't bury your ask.

**Bad Opening**:
> Hi Sarah,
>
> I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out and touch base about something that came up during our conversation last week. It's related to the project we discussed...

**Good Opening**:
> Hi Sarah,
>
> Requesting approval for TopCorp contract ($50K) by Friday.

Why it works: The recipient knows immediately what you need and by when.

---

### Step 3: Provide Only Essential Context

Add 2-3 sentences of necessary background‚Äîno more. If they need more details, they'll ask.

**Context Do's**:
- Relevant deadlines or dates
- Why you're reaching out
- What decision is needed
- Impact if action isn't taken

**Context Don'ts**:
- Internal team gossip
- Excuses or blame
- Too much history
- Irrelevant information

---

### Step 4: End with Clear Next Steps

Close with a specific call to action‚Äînever assume they'll know what to do next.

**Bad Closing**:
> Let me know what you think.

**Good Closings**:
> Please reply with "approved" by EOD Friday to maintain timeline.

Or:

> Let's meet Thursday 2pm to discuss? I'll send a calendar invite if that works.

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Following Up on a Request

**Situation**: You requested feedback on a proposal 3 days ago. Still no response.

**Bad Email**:
```
Subject: Re: Proposal Feedback Needed

Hi Mike,
Just checking in on the proposal I sent. Let me know when you can take a look. Thanks.
```

**Good Email**:
```
Subject: Follow-up: Proposal Feedback Needed by EOD Today

Hi Mike,

Following up on the Q4 marketing proposal sent Monday. We need your input by end of day to meet our submission deadline (Friday).

Quick question: Any specific sections you'd like me to prioritize for feedback?

Best,
Jane
```

**Why it works**:
- Sets deadline context
- Offers to narrow scope if needed
- Professional but direct

---

### Scenario 2: Apologizing for a Mistake

**Situation**: You sent incorrect data in a client email yesterday.

**Bad Email**:
```
Subject: Sorry!

Hi everyone,
So sorry about the mistake in yesterday's email. Won't happen again!
```

**Good Email**:
```
Subject: Correction: Updated Figures for Q3 Report

Hi Team,

Correction to yesterday's email: The revenue figure in the Q3 summary should be $847K, not $874K. I've attached the corrected spreadsheet.

This error doesn't affect the overall conclusion‚Äîwe still exceeded targets by 12%. The updated file includes a change log.

Thanks for your patience,
John
```

**Why it works**:
- Acknowledges error without excessive apologizing
- Provides the correction immediately
- Explains impact (minimal in this case)
- Takes responsibility

### Scenario 3: Requesting a Meeting

**Situation**: You need to sync with your manager about a new project.

**Bad Email**:

Do you have time to talk this week?
```

**Good Email**:
```
Subject: Meeting Request: Project Kickoff - 30 Min

Hi Maria,

I'd like to discuss the new TopCorp project kickoff plan. Need your input on timeline and resource allocation.

Proposed times (your calendar):

---

**Good Email**:
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Using Unclear Subject Lines

‚ùå **Don't**: "Quick question", "Important", "FYI", "Hello"

‚úÖ **Do**: Be specific‚Äî"Budget approval needed by Friday", "Project timeline risk: Action required"

**Why**: Generic subjects get lost or ignored. Specific subjects get results.

---

### Pitfall 2: Writing Novels

‚ùå **Don't**: Long paragraphs with multiple topics buried throughout

‚úÖ **Do**: Use bullets, short paragraphs (3-4 sentences), and white space

**Why**: People skim emails. If it looks dense, they'll postpone reading it.

---

### Pitfall 3: Vague Action Items

‚ùå **Don't**: "Let me know", "Get back to me", "Thoughts?"

‚úÖ **Do**: "Please send final numbers by COB Friday", "Let's meet Tuesday 2pm‚Äîdoes that work?"

**Why**: Specificity drives action. Vague requests lead to no response.

---

### Pitfall 4: Excessive Emoticons or Casualness

‚ùå **Don't**: "Hey! üòäüòä Just wanted to quickly touch base LOL"

‚úÖ **Do**: Keep it professional, warm but businesslike

**Why**: Your email communicates your brand. Keep it professional unless you know the person well and context is casual.

---

## Your Turn: Practice Exercise

Think of an email you need to send in the next week‚Äîmaybe a follow-up, request, or update.

**Write a draft using the structure:**

1. **Subject Line** (specific and actionable):
   ```
   
   ```

2. **Opening** (main point in first sentence):
   ```
   
   ```

3. **Context** (2-3 sentences only):
   ```
   
   ```

4. **Next Step** (specific and clear):
   ```
   
   ```

5. **Review**:
   - Would you open this email if it landed in your inbox? ‚úì/‚úó
   - Is the action item clear? ‚úì/‚úó
   - Can you read it in 30 seconds? ‚úì/‚úó

## Pro Tips

üíé **The 5-Minute Rule**: If it takes more than 5 minutes to write, pick up the phone or schedule a meeting instead.

üíé **The Phone Test**: Could you read your email over the phone in one breath? If not, it's too long.

üíé **Pre-empt Questions**: Anticipate follow-up questions and answer them in the email to minimize back-and-forth.

üíé **Email Rules of 3**: 
- 3 short paragraphs max
- 3 seconds to understand the purpose
- 3 months before you reply, assume they forgot you emailed

üíé **Compose at End of Day**: Write emails when you're calmer, schedule send for next morning. You'll catch more errors and less heated language.
