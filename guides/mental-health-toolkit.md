## PART I: COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) BASICS

### The CBT Model

**Situation ‚Üí Thoughts ‚Üí Feelings ‚Üí Behaviors ‚Üí Consequences**

**Key Insight**: You can't always control situations or immediate feelings, but you CAN control thoughts and behaviors‚Äîwhich then change feelings.

### Cognitive Distortions (Thinking Errors)

#### 1. All-or-Nothing Thinking
**Distortion**: "I ate one cookie, my diet is ruined"
**Reality**: One cookie is <5% of daily calories
**Reframe**: "I can enjoy this and get back on track next meal"

#### 2. Catastrophizing
**Distortion**: "I made a mistake, I'll get fired and be homeless"
**Reality**: One mistake rarely has extreme consequences
**Reframe**: "I made a mistake. I'll fix it and learn from it"

#### 3. Mind Reading
**Distortion**: "They didn't respond, they must hate me"
**Reality**: You can't know what others think
**Reframe**: "They might be busy. I'll follow up if needed"

#### 4. Should Statements
**Distortion**: "I should be further along by now"
**Reality**: "Should" creates unnecessary guilt
**Reframe**: "I'm exactly where my actions have led me. What's my next step?"

#### 5. Emotional Reasoning
**Distortion**: "I feel anxious, so something bad will happen"
**Reality**: Feelings aren't facts
**Reframe**: "I feel anxious, which is just a feeling. Let's look at evidence"

### The Thought Record Exercise

**When experiencing strong emotion:**

| Situation | Automatic Thought | Emotion (0-100) | Evidence For | Evidence Against | Alternative Thought | New Emotion (0-100) |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Boss didn't respond to email | She's mad at me | Anxious (80) | She usually responds quickly | Could be in meetings, lots of other reasons | She's probably busy, I'll follow up | Anxious (30) |

**Practice Daily**: One thought record per day for 30 days

---

## PART II: MINDFULNESS & PRESENT-MOMENT AWARENESS

### What Mindfulness Is (and Isn't)

**IS:**

## PART V: BUILDING RESILIENCE

### The Resilience Formula

**Resilience = Adversity √ó (Skills + Support + Mindset)**

### Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset

**Fixed**: "I'm bad at this"
**Growth**: "I'm not good at this yet"

**Fixed**: "This failure proves I can't succeed"
**Growth**: "This failure teaches me what doesn't work"

**Fixed**: "I can't change"
**Growth**: "I can develop any skill with practice"

**Practice**: Append "yet" to any "I can't" statement

### The Stoic Dichotomy of Control

**Things You Control:**
- Your actions
- Your thoughts (with practice)
- Your effort
- Your responses
- Your values

**Things You Don't Control:**
- Other people's actions/thoughts
- Past events
- Future outcomes
- Weather
- Most things

**Practice**: Focus energy on what you control, accept the rest

### Cognitive Reframing

**Situation**: Lost job

**Victim Frame**: "This is terrible, my life is ruined"
**Neutral Frame**: "I lost my job, which is unfortunate"
**Growth Frame**: "This is an opportunity to find something better aligned with my goals"

**All can be true. Which helps you most?**

## FINAL THOUGHTS

Mental health is not fixed‚Äîit's a practice, a skill, a garden to tend.

Bad days will come. What matters is having tools to navigate them and the wisdom to use them.

**You are not your thoughts.**
**You are not your feelings.**
**You are the awareness observing both.**

Start with one technique. Practice it daily. Build from there.

Your brain is neuroplastic‚Äîit changes based on what you practice. Practice peace, and peace becomes easier.

**Be patient with yourself. Healing isn't linear.**

You've got this.
