# How to Run Effective 1-on-1 Meetings

## The Problem

Most 1-on-1s are wasted opportunities: status updates that could be emails, awkward silence, or rushed conversations with no follow-up. Done well, 1-on-1s are where real leadership happens—where you build trust, uncover problems early, and develop your team.

## Quick Wins (2 min)

1. **Schedule them consistently** (weekly or bi-weekly, same time, same day)
2. **Let the reportee drive the agenda** (you facilitate, they own the topics)
3. **Listen more than you talk** (aim for 70/30)
4. **Take notes and follow up** (show you're paying attention)

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Set the Right Frequency and Duration

**Frequency rules of thumb**:
- New hires: Weekly for first 3 months, then bi-weekly
- Experienced team members: Bi-weekly is usually sufficient
- High-stakes or struggling team members: Weekly until stable
- Senior contributors: Monthly can work if they're highly independent

**Duration**:
- 30 minutes is the sweet spot for most people
- 15-20 minutes for senior contributors or quick check-ins
- 45-60 minutes for deeper career development discussions

**Best practices**:
- Same day of week, same time (creates a predictable rhythm)
- Block time immediately after for notes and follow-ups
- Never cancel unless it's a true emergency (and reschedule immediately)

---

### Step 2: Prepare (But Don't Over-Prepare)

**Your preparation** (5-10 minutes):
- Review notes from last week
- Note anything you wanted to follow up on
- Check in on their current projects (quick skim, not deep dive)
- Prepare 2-3 open-ended questions

**Their preparation**:
- Send them a simple agenda template 24 hours before
- Ask them to add 2-3 items they want to discuss
- Frame it as "What's on your mind that would be useful to talk about?"

**Template to send**:
```
Hi [Name],

Looking forward to our 1-on-1 tomorrow at [time]. 

Here's what I'm planning to discuss:
- Follow-up on [specific item from last week]

What would you like to add to the agenda? Reply with 2-3 items you'd like to cover.

See you tomorrow!
```

### Step 3: Create the Right Environment

**Location matters**:
- Best: Neutral territory (break room, coffee shop, or walking meeting)
- Good: Their workspace or a comfortable office
- Avoid: Your office (power dynamic, interruptions)

**Phone/video considerations**:
- Turn off notifications
- Close laptop if in person
- Make eye contact (video or in-person)
- No "quick emails" or multitasking

---

### Step 4: Start with Rapport

**First 5 minutes**: Light conversation that builds connection.

**What to talk about**:
- How was your weekend?
- Any hobbies or interests they've mentioned
- Family or personal updates they've shared
- Work-adjacent topics (a movie, event, industry news)

**What to avoid**:
- Jumping straight into work
- Personal topics they haven't brought up
- Politics, religion, or controversial topics
- Complaining about other team members or company issues

**Why it matters**: People don't trust managers they don't know. Rapport precedes productive conversations.

---

### Step 5: Let Them Talk

**Your role**: Ask questions and listen. Their role: Lead the conversation.

**The 70/30 rule**: They should talk 70% of the time, you talk 30%.

**Powerful opening questions**:
- "What's on your mind?"
- "What are your biggest priorities right now?"
- "Where are you getting stuck?"
- "What's working well, and what isn't?"

**Listen for**:
- Problems they're hinting at
- Signs of frustration or burnout
- Growth opportunities they're interested in
- Ideas or suggestions they're reluctant to voice

---

### Step 6: Address the Real Issues

Most 1-on-1s stay surface-level. Your job is to dig deeper.

**Signs there's a bigger issue**:
- Vague answers ("It's fine", "I guess")
- Body language that doesn't match words (saying yes but looking frustrated)
- Silence or hesitation when you ask follow-ups
- Complaints about symptoms, not root causes

**How to dig deeper**:

If they say: "The project is going fine."

You ask: "What does 'fine' mean? What would make it great instead of just fine?"

If they say: "I'm managing everything okay."

You ask: "Where are you feeling stretched? What would make your life easier?"

If they say: "The team dynamics are good."

You ask: "What's actually hard about working with the team? What would you change if you could?"

**The goal**: Get past politeness to what's actually happening.

---

### Step 7: Commit to Action and Follow Up

**Before the meeting ends** (last 5 minutes):

1. Summarize what you discussed
2. Identify any action items (who owns what, by when)
3. Put it in your calendar or notes
4. Schedule the next meeting (if not already blocked)

**Action item template**:
```
What: [Specific action]
Who: [Name]
When: [Deadline]
Why: [Context/importance]
```

**Example**:
> "We discussed that you need more visibility into the product roadmap. My action is to set up a monthly product review for your team—I'll do that by Friday. Your action is to prepare a list of questions you want to address in that review—send it to me by Wednesday. Does that work?"

**Follow-up within 24 hours**:
Send a brief summary email (or Slack message) with action items:
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for the productive 1-on-1 today. Here's what we discussed:

- [Summary of topic 1]
- [Summary of topic 2]
- [Summary of topic 3]

Action items:
- You: [Action] by [deadline]
- Me: [Action] by [deadline]

Let me know if I missed anything. See you next week!
```

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Handling a Struggling Team Member

**The situation**: They're behind on deliverables, seem stressed, and communication has decreased.

**Your 1-on-1 approach**:

1. **Start with empathy** (not blame):
   > "Hey, I noticed you might be dealing with a lot right now. How are things going?"

2. **Listen first, don't jump to solutions**:
   > "What's the biggest challenge you're facing?"

3. **Acknowledge their situation**:
   > "It sounds like you're dealing with [X, Y, Z]. That's a lot to manage. What would help most?"

4. **Collaborate on solutions** (don't prescribe):
   > "What do you think we should do? How can I support you?"

5. **Create a plan together**:
   > "Let's break this down into smaller pieces. What do you think is most urgent?"

**Key principle**: Help them feel supported, not judged.

---

### Scenario 2: Career Development Discussion

**The situation**: They ask about growth opportunities or express interest in a promotion.

**Your approach**:

1. **Understand their goals**:
   > "What does that next role look like for you? What would make you excited?"

2. **Identify the gap**:
   > "What skills do you need to develop to get there?"

3. **Create a growth plan**:
   > "Let's outline 2-3 projects or experiences that would help you build those skills."

4. **Check in regularly**:
   > "Let's review your progress on this in our next few 1-on-1s."

**Action plan template**:
- Skill to develop: [X]
- Project/experience: [Y]
- Timeframe: [Z]
- How we'll measure progress: [Success metrics]

---

### Scenario 3: Discussing a Conflict Between Team Members

**The situation**: They mention tension with a colleague, but they're being vague.

**Your approach**:

1. **Dig deeper**:
   > "Tell me more about what's happening with [Name]. What's the situation?"

2. **Stay neutral and curious**:
   > "How do you think [Name] is experiencing this? What might be going on from their perspective?"

3. **Help them own their part**:
   > "What could you do differently? How might you approach this?"

4. **Offer support, not solutions**:
   > "What would be helpful from me? Should we have a three-way conversation?"

**Your role**: Coach them to navigate the situation themselves, not solve it for them.

---

### Scenario 4: They're Quiet or Reserved

**The situation**: They give short answers, don't volunteer information, and conversations feel stalled.

**Your approach**:

1. **Try different question types**:
   - Instead of "How are things going?" (too broad)
   - Try "What's been the highlight of your week?" (specific, positive)

2. **Use hypotheticals**:
   > "If you could change one thing about how we work, what would it be?"

3. **Ask for their opinion**:
   > "I'm thinking about [strategy/project]. What's your take?"

4. **Share something yourself**:
   > "I'm working on [challenge]. I'd love your thoughts on it."

5. **Be patient**:
   > Some people take longer to open up. Keep showing up consistently.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Status Update Instead of Development

❌ **Don't**: Use the 1-on-1 for project status and task coordination.

✅ **Do**: Handle status updates separately. Use 1-on-1s for growth, development, and relationship building.

**Why**: If 1-on-1s are just status updates, they become transactional check-ins, not developmental conversations.

---

### Pitfall 2: You Do All the Talking

❌ **Don't**: Monologue about the company, strategy, or your opinions.

✅ **Do**: Listen 70% of the time. Ask questions. Let them lead.

**Why**: If you're doing all the talking, you're not learning about them or their experience.

---

### Pitfall 3: No Follow-Up on Action Items

❌ **Don't**: Discuss action items and then forget them.

✅ **Do**: Document in writing, set deadlines, and follow up in the next 1-on-1.

**Why**: Trust erodes when commitments are made but not kept.

---

### Pitfall 4: Canceling or Moving Meetings

❌ **Don't**: Treat 1-on-1s as optional or easily rescheduled.

✅ **Do**: Treat them as sacred calendar time. Only cancel for true emergencies.

**Why**: Consistency builds trust. Canceling sends the message "other things are more important than you."

---

### Pitfall 5: Having Them When Everything's Fine

❌ **Don't**: Skip or rush 1-on-1s when things seem to be going well.

✅ **Do**: Maintain regular meetings even during calm periods. That's when you can focus on development.

**Why**: In crisis, you can't pause everything for 1-on-1s. Build the habit during peace.

## Your Turn: Practice Exercise

Think about an upcoming 1-on-1 you have scheduled (or schedule one).

**Planning**:
1. What's the purpose of this 1-on-1? (Keep it developmental, not transactional)
2. What 2-3 open-ended questions will you ask?
3. What action items do you need to follow up on from last time?
4. What's the one thing you most want to learn about them or their experience?

**During the meeting**:
1. Track how much you talk vs. how much they talk (aim for 30/70)
2. Write down their verbatim answers to your questions (practice active listening)
3. Identify one thing they didn't explicitly say but you picked up from their tone or body language

**After the meeting**:
1. What was the most important thing you learned?
2. What action items did you commit to? (Write them down with deadlines)
3. What's your plan to follow up?
