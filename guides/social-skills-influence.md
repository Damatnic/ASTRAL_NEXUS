- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What did you learn from that?"
- "What happened next?"

#### The Story-Telling Framework

**Structure for Compelling Stories**:

1. **Hook**: Grab attention immediately
2. **Context**: Set the scene briefly
3. **Conflict**: What went wrong or was challenging
4. **Action**: What you did
5. **Resolution**: How it turned out
6. **Lesson**: What it means (optional)

**Keep stories**:
- Brief (90 seconds max for most social situations)
- Relevant to conversation
- Focused on others' interests
- Humble (not bragging)

#### Conversation Threading

**What It Is**: Finding new topics from current conversation

**Example**:

- Thread Options:
  - Travel: "What was the highlight?"
  - Food: "Did you try any amazing food?"
  - Work: "Was it for work or pleasure?"

**Always have 3-4 threads available** to keep conversation flowing.

### Topics That Create Connection

3. **Environment**: Comment on surroundings
4. **Ask question**: Open-ended about them
5. **Share observation**: "I just realized..."

**Don't**:
- Panic and ramble
- Fill every second
- Make it awkward by pointing it out
- Force conversation when natural ending

4. **Disagreements**: Different opinions or approaches
5. **Relationship Issues**: Personal conflicts

### The Feedback Framework

**Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI)**:

**Firm But Warm**:

- Everyone experiences it

**Learn from Rejection**:
- Was there something to improve?
- Or just bad fit/timing?

**Move On Quickly**:
- Don't dwell
