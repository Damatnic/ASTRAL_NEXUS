## FINAL THOUGHTS

Privacy is not about having something to hide‚Äîit's about having something to protect: your freedom, autonomy, and human dignity.

Security is not a product but a process. It's not about being perfectly secure (impossible) but about being secure enough for your threat model.

**Start small, build habits, increase gradually.**

Your digital self-defense journey starts now.
