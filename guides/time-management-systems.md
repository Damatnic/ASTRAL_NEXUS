---

## PART I: GTD (GETTING THINGS DONE)

### The Five Steps

#### 1. Capture Everything
**Every thought, task, idea goes into trusted system**

**Capture Points:**
- Physical inbox (one location)
- Digital inbox (notes app, email)
- Voice memos (driving, walking)
- Quick notes (bedside, pocket)

**Rule**: Out of your head, into the system

#### 2. Clarify What It Means
**Process inbox to zero daily**

**The Workflow:**
```
Is it actionable?
├─ NO → Trash / Reference / Someday-Maybe
└─ YES → What's the next action?
    ├─ <2 minutes → Do now
    ├─ Delegate → Track in "Waiting For"
    └─ Defer → Add to appropriate list
```

**Clarifying Questions:**
- What does "done" look like?
- What's the very next physical action?
- Who's responsible?
- When does it need to be done?

#### 3. Organize
**The GTD Lists:**
- **Next Actions**: Specific, physical, doable tasks by context
  - @computer
  - @phone
  - @errands
  - @home
  - @office
- **Projects**: Multi-step outcomes requiring >1 action
- **Waiting For**: Delegated or external dependencies
- **Someday/Maybe**: Ideas for future consideration
- **Calendar**: Time-specific commitments only

**Key Rule**: Calendar is sacred - only hard-landscape commitments

#### 4. Reflect
**Daily**: Process inboxes to zero
**Weekly Review** (2 hours):
- [ ] Empty all inboxes
- [ ] Process loose papers/notes
- [ ] Review Next Actions lists
- [ ] Review Projects list
- [ ] Review Waiting For
- [ ] Review Someday/Maybe
- [ ] Review calendar (past and future)

**Monthly Review**:
- Goals progress check
- Areas of responsibility audit
- Update projects list

#### 5. Engage
**Choose next action based on:**
1. **Context**: Where you are (@home, @office)
2. **Time Available**: 5 min? 2 hours?
3. **Energy Level**: Creative work vs admin
4. **Priority**: What matters most now?

### 🎯 QUICK WIN: The 2-Minute Rule

Any task under 2 minutes: DO IT NOW
- Reply to email
- File document
- Make quick call
- Add item to list

**Why**: Processing it later takes more time than doing it now

---

## PART II: PARA METHOD

### The Four Categories

#### P - Projects
**Active outcomes with deadline**
- "Launch new website by Dec 31"
- "Plan vacation for June"
- "Complete annual review by Friday"

**Criteria:**
- Has specific end goal
- Has timeline
- Requires multiple actions

#### A - Areas of Responsibility
**Ongoing standards to maintain**
- Health and fitness
- Finances
- Home management
- Career development
- Relationships
- Personal growth

**Criteria:**
- No end date
- Continuous maintenance
- Standard to uphold

#### R - Resources
**Topics of interest or potential use**
- Marketing strategies
- Recipe collection
- Programming tutorials
- Travel inspiration

**Criteria:**
- Reference material
- May become project someday
- Organized by topic

#### A - Archives
**Inactive projects and old resources**
- Completed projects
- Inactive resources
- Old areas no longer relevant

**Criteria:**
- Not currently active
- Keep for reference
- Out of sight

### PARA File Structure

```
📁 1-Projects/
  📁 Website Redesign/
  📁 Annual Tax Prep/
  📁 Kitchen Renovation/

📁 2-Areas/
  📁 Health/
  📁 Finance/
  📁 Career/
  📁 Learning/

📁 3-Resources/
  📁 Productivity/
  📁 Marketing/
  📁 Design/
  📁 Code Snippets/

📁 4-Archives/
  📁 2024 Projects/
  📁 Old Resources/
```

### Implementation Guide

**Step 1: Create Structure**
- Make four main folders
- Create subfolders in Areas for responsibilities
- Add inbox folder for capture

**Step 2: Migrate Existing Files** (One-Time)
- Go through every file
- Ask: "Is this supporting an active project?"
  - YES → Projects folder
  - NO → Continue
- "Is this about an ongoing responsibility?"
  - YES → Areas folder
  - NO → Continue
- "Might I need this for future project?"
  - YES → Resources folder
  - NO → Archives or delete

**Step 3: Maintain System**
- New files go directly to correct folder
- Weekly review: move completed to archives
- Monthly: purge unused resources

### 🚀 QUICK WIN: The 15-Minute PARA Setup

1. Create 4 folders (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
2. Move your 10 most important active files to Projects
3. Create 5 Area folders for your key responsibilities
4. Done - refine over time

## PART III: ZETTELKASTEN (SECOND BRAIN)

### The Atomic Note System

**Concept**: Small, interconnected notes that compound into knowledge

#### Zettelkasten Principles

**1. One Idea Per Note**
- Atomic and focused
- Can stand alone
- Easily linkable

**2. Write in Your Own Words**
- Forces understanding
- Creates connections
- Aids memory

**3. Link Prolifically**
- Connect related ideas
- Show contrasts
- Build structure

**4. Use Unique IDs**
- Timestamp: `202501191430`
- Sequential: `1a2b3c`
- Makes every note findable

#### Note Template

```markdown
# 202501191430 - Compound Interest Power

## Content
Compound interest is when your returns generate their own returns.
Albert Einstein allegedly called it "the eighth wonder of the world."

Formula: A = P(1 + r)^t
- A = Final amount
- P = Principal
- r = Interest rate
- t = Time periods

## Examples
$10,000 at 10% for 30 years = $174,494
The last 10 years earn more than the first 20 combined.

## PART V: ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

### Time Blocking + GTD

**Calendar Template:**
```
6:00-7:00 AM   Morning routine
7:00-9:00 AM   Deep work block (most important task)
9:00-9:30 AM   Email/admin (GTD process)
9:30-12:00 PM  Project work
12:00-1:00 PM  Lunch + walk
1:00-3:00 PM   Meetings/collaboration
3:00-3:30 PM   Break + exercise
3:30-5:00 PM   Deep work block #2
5:00-5:30 PM   Daily review (GTD)
5:30 PM        Hard stop
```

**Key**: Guard deep work blocks, batch similar tasks

### The Quarterly Planning Process

**Every 13 Weeks:**
1. **Life Areas Review** (PARA Areas)
   - Health: On track?
   - Finances: Progress toward goals?
   - Career: Advancing?
   - Relationships: Healthy?

2. **Project Selection** (GTD Projects)
   - What will move key areas forward?
   - Choose 3-5 major projects max
   - Define success criteria

3. **Resource Audit** (PARA Resources)
   - What resources do I have?
   - What do I need to acquire?
   - What should be archived?

4. **Knowledge Review** (Zettelkasten)
   - What patterns emerged?
   - What connections formed?
   - What to learn next?

### Energy Management Integration

**Assign tasks by energy level:**

**Peak Energy (morning):**
- Creative work
- Complex problems
- Important writing
- Strategic thinking

**Medium Energy (mid-day):**
- Meetings
- Collaboration
- Planning
