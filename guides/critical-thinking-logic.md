## PART I: LOGIC FUNDAMENTALS

### Deductive vs Inductive Reasoning

#### Deductive (General â†’ Specific)
**Structure**: If premises are true, conclusion MUST be true

**Example:**
- Premise 1: All humans are mortal
- Premise 2: Socrates is human
- Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal

**Validity**: Structure is correct
**Soundness**: Structure correct AND premises true

#### Inductive (Specific â†’ General)
**Structure**: If premises are true, conclusion is LIKELY true

**Example:**
- Every swan I've seen is white
- Therefore, all swans are white
- **(False! Black swans exist)**

**Strength**: How likely premises make conclusion true

### Valid vs Sound Arguments

**Valid but Unsound:**
- All birds can fly
- Penguins are birds
- Therefore, penguins can fly
- **(Valid structure, false premise, unsound)**

**Invalid but True Conclusion:**
- Most cats are mammals
- Fluffy is a mammal
- Therefore, Fluffy is a cat
- **(True conclusion, but affirming the consequent fallacy)**

### ðŸš€ QUICK WIN: The 5 Whys

**Get to root cause:**
1. Problem: "I'm always late"
2. Why? "I wake up late"
3. Why? "I hit snooze"
4. Why? "I'm tired in morning"
5. Why? "I stay up too late"
6. Why? "I scroll phone in bed"

**Root Cause**: Phone in bedroom
**Solution**: Charge phone outside room

---

## PART II: COGNITIVE BIASES (YOUR BRAIN'S BUGS)

### The Big 25 Biases Everyone Falls For

#### 1. Confirmation Bias
**What**: Seek info confirming existing beliefs, ignore contradicting info
**Example**: Believe coffee is healthy â†’ only remember studies showing benefits
**Counter**: Actively seek disconfirming evidence

#### 2. Anchoring Bias
**What**: Over-rely on first piece of information
**Example**: $1000 jacket on sale for $500 seems cheap (anchored to $1000)
**Counter**: Evaluate independently of initial number

#### 3. Sunk Cost Fallacy
**What**: Continue because you've already invested time/money
**Example**: Watch bad movie to end because paid for ticket
**Counter**: Evaluate based only on future value

#### 4. Availability Heuristic
**What**: Judge likelihood by how easily examples come to mind
**Example**: Fear plane crashes more than car crashes (planes more memorable)
**Counter**: Look at actual statistics

#### 5. Dunning-Kruger Effect
**What**: Low-skill people overestimate abilities, experts underestimate
**Example**: Novices think task is easy, experts know complexity
**Counter**: Assume you know less than you think

#### 6. Hindsight Bias
**What**: "I knew it all along" after outcome is known
**Example**: "Obviously that company would succeed"
**Counter**: Write predictions before outcomes known

#### 7. Fundamental Attribution Error
**What**: Attribute others' behavior to character, your own to situation
**Example**: They're late = inconsiderate; You're late = traffic unavoidable
**Counter**: Consider situational factors for others too

#### 8. Bandwagon Effect
**What**: Believe things because many others do
**Example**: "Everyone's investing in crypto, so should I"
**Counter**: Evaluate independently of popularity

#### 9. Status Quo Bias
**What**: Prefer things stay the same
**Example**: Keep bad job because change is scary
**Counter**: Evaluate: is current situation actually optimal?

#### 10. Loss Aversion
**What**: Fear losses more than equivalent gains
**Example**: Won't risk $100 to win $150 (equal expected value)
**Counter**: Think in expected value, not fear

### Advanced Biases

#### 11-25 Quick Reference:
11. **Recency Bias**: Recent events seem more likely
12. **Halo Effect**: One good trait â†’ assume all good traits
13. **Survivorship Bias**: See successes, miss failures
14. **Clustering Illusion**: See patterns in randomness
15. **Gambler's Fallacy**: Past doesn't affect independent future events
16. **Self-Serving Bias**: Success = my skill; Failure = bad luck
17. **Mere Exposure Effect**: Familiar = better
18. **Negativity Bias**: Negative info weighs more than positive
19. **Optimism Bias**: Overestimate good outcomes
20. **Planning Fallacy**: Underestimate time/cost
21. **Curse of Knowledge**: Can't remember not knowing something
22. **IKEA Effect**: Overvalue things you built
23. **Endowment Effect**: Overvalue things you own
24. **Framing Effect**: Presentation affects choice
25. **Decoy Effect**: Irrelevant option influences choice

### ðŸŽ¯ PRACTICE: Bias Spotting Journal

**Daily for 14 days:**
1. Notice one bias in yourself
2. Identify which bias
3. How it affected thinking/behavior
4. What would unbiased thinking look like?

**Result**: Awareness reduces bias impact by 30-50%

## PART III: LOGICAL FALLACIES

### Formal Fallacies (Structure Errors)

#### 1. Affirming the Consequent
- If A, then B
- B is true
- Therefore A is true
- **Wrong!** (Other things could cause B)

**Example:**
- If it's raining, the street is wet
- The street is wet
- Therefore, it's raining
- **(Fire hydrant could have caused wetness)**

#### 2. Denying the Antecedent
- If A, then B
- A is false
- Therefore B is false
- **Wrong!**

**Example:**
- If study hard, then pass test
- Didn't study hard
- Therefore, won't pass test
- **(Could pass anyway - lucky, knew material)**

### Informal Fallacies (Content Errors)

#### 3. Ad Hominem
**Attack person, not argument**
- "You're wrong because you're ugly"
- "Can't trust him, he's divorced"

**Counter**: "Evaluate argument on merits, not person"

#### 4. Straw Man
**Misrepresent argument to defeat easier version**
- Them: "We should have social programs"
- You: "So you want full communism?"

**Counter**: "Steelman" instead - strongest version of their argument

#### 5. Appeal to Authority
**Authority â‰  correct (but raises probability)**
- Valid: "Climate scientists agree on warming"
- Invalid: "My doctor says vaccines cause autism" (consensus disagrees)

**Test**: Is authority in relevant field? What's consensus?

#### 6. Appeal to Emotion
**Use feelings instead of logic**
- "Think of the children!"
- "Patriots support this bill"

**Counter**: "Does emotional appeal address actual argument?"

#### 7. False Dichotomy
**Present only two options when more exist**
- "Either you're with us or against us"
- "Love it or leave it"

**Counter**: "What other options exist?"

#### 8. Slippery Slope
**Claim small action â†’ extreme consequence without evidence**
- "If we allow gay marriage, next people will marry dogs"

**Counter**: "Where's evidence for chain of consequences?"

#### 9. Hasty Generalization
**Conclude from too small sample**
- "I met two rude New Yorkers, all New Yorkers are rude"

**Counter**: "How large and representative is sample?"

#### 10. Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc
**After, therefore because of**
- Ice cream sales correlate with drowning deaths
- Therefore ice cream causes drowning
- **(Both caused by summer weather)**

**Counter**: Correlation â‰  causation

### ðŸŽ¯ PRACTICE: Fallacy Spotting

**Watch political debate, identify:**
- 5 ad hominem attacks
- 3 straw man arguments
- 2 false dichotomies
- 1 appeal to emotion

**Read news article, identify:**
- Hasty generalizations
- False cause assumptions
- Cherry-picked evidence

---

## PART IV: DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORKS

### Expected Value Thinking

**Formula**: EV = (Probability of Outcome) Ã— (Value of Outcome)

**Example - Job Offer:**
- Current job: 100% Ã— $70k = $70k EV
- New job: 80% works out Ã— $90k + 20% laid off Ã— $0 = $72k EV
- **Verdict**: Slight edge to new job, but consider other factors

### The Pre-Mortem Technique

**Before making decision:**
1. Imagine it failed spectacularly
2. "It's one year later, this decision was a disaster because..."
3. List all reasons it could fail
4. Address each before proceeding

**Result**: Identify blind spots before committing

### Second-Order Thinking

**First Order**: "What will immediately happen?"
**Second Order**: "And then what? And then what?"

**Example - Free Time:**
- First order: "Play video games = fun"
- Second order: "3 hours gaming â†’ nothing accomplished â†’ feel guilty â†’ worse mood"
- Alternative: "1 hour gaming â†’ 2 hours productive â†’ feel accomplished"

### Eisenhower Matrix (Applied)

```
          URGENT     |    NOT URGENT
          -----------|--------------
IMPORTANT | DO NOW    | SCHEDULE
          | (Crisis)  | (Goals)
          |-----------|
NOT       | DELEGATE  | ELIMINATE
IMPORTANT | (Busy)    | (Waste)
```

**Most people live in Quadrant 1 (urgent/important)**
**Successful people live in Quadrant 2 (important/not urgent)**

**Strategy**: Schedule Q2 time, minimize Q1 by preventing crises

---

## PART V: INFORMATION EVALUATION

### The CRAAP Test (Source Credibility)

**C**urrency: How recent?
**R**elevance: Does it answer your question?
**A**uthority: Who's the author? Qualified?
**A**ccuracy: Can you verify elsewhere?
**P**urpose: What's the intent? Inform or persuade?

### Media Literacy Checklist

**Before sharing information:**
- [ ] Checked source credibility
- [ ] Verified with 2+ independent sources
- [ ] Looked for original source (not just summary)
- [ ] Considered author's potential biases
- [ ] Checked date (could be old news)
- [ ] Clicked through (not just headline)
- [ ] Verified images (reverse image search)

**Red Flags:**
- Extreme emotional language
- All caps headlines
- No author listed
- No sources cited
- URL seems off
- Only one site reporting

### Statistics BS Detection

**Watch For:**
- **Relative vs Absolute**: "50% increase!" (from 2 to 3 cases)
- **Base Rate Neglect**: "90% of terrorists are X" (but 99.99% of X aren't terrorists)
- **Sample Size**: Survey of 10 people
- **Selection Bias**: Online polls (only motivated respond)
- **Correlation â‰  Causation**: Ice cream and drowning

**Always Ask:**
- What's the sample size?
- Who was studied?
- What's the actual effect size?
- What alternative explanations exist?

---

## PART VI: ARGUMENT CONSTRUCTION

### The Toulmin Model

**Claim**: What you're arguing
**Grounds**: Evidence supporting claim
**Warrant**: Why evidence supports claim
**Backing**: Support for warrant
**Qualifier**: Degree of certainty
**Rebuttal**: Acknowledge counterarguments

**Example:**
- **Claim**: We should invest in index funds
- **Grounds**: 90% of active managers underperform index over 15 years
- **Warrant**: Past performance indicates future patterns
- **Backing**: Data from 50+ years supports this
- **Qualifier**: Probably, for most investors
- **Rebuttal**: Unless you have exceptional skill or insider information

### Steelmanning (Opposite of Straw Man)

**Process:**
1. State opposing view in strongest possible terms
2. Add details that make it more convincing
3. Only then argue against it

**Example:**
- Weak: "They just want free stuff"
- Steelman: "They argue that basic needs being met increases overall productivity and reduces social costs, potentially being revenue-neutral long-term through reduced healthcare and crime"

**Why**: Forces you to truly understand opposing view

---

## PART VII: REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS

### Scenario 1: Evaluating Health Claims

**Claim**: "This supplement cures cancer!"

**Critical Questions:**
- Who's making claim? (Credentials?)
- What's the evidence? (Anecdotes or studies?)
- Published in peer-reviewed journal?
- What's conflict of interest? (Selling product?)
- What do experts say? (Medical consensus?)
- Too good to be true? (Usually is)

### Scenario 2: Political Arguments

**Claim**: "Policy X will destroy the economy!"

**Analysis:**
- Define "destroy" (vague language)
- What's evidence? (Models, past examples, expert opinion?)
- What's base rate? (How often do policies "destroy" economies?)
- What alternative explanations? (Other factors in examples cited?)
- What do non-partisan economists say?

### Scenario 3: Personal Decision

**Should I buy this house?**

**Emotion-Based**: "I love it! It's perfect!"
**Critical Thinking**:
- Can I afford 25% less than pre-approved? (Conservative buffer)
- Comparable sales data?
- Inspection revealed issues?
- Will I still live here in 5 years?
- What's my BATNA? (Best alternative)
- Am I rushing due to FOMO?
- Does this align with long-term goals?

## ðŸŽ¯ PRACTICE EXERCISES

### Exercise 1: Argument Analysis

**Find 5 opinion articles, for each identify:**
1. Main claim
2. Evidence provided
3. Logical structure
4. Fallacies present
5. Unstated assumptions
6. Strongest counterargument

**Goal**: Separate rhetoric from reasoning

### Exercise 2: Devil's Advocate

**For every strong opinion you hold:**
1. Write best case for opposite view
2. Find evidence supporting it
3. Identify where you might be wrong
4. Strengthen your actual position

**Result**: Nuanced understanding, fewer blind spots

### Exercise 3: The Prediction Game

**Make falsifiable predictions:**
- "Stock market will rise 5% next month"
- "I'll finish project by Friday"
- "Friend will love this gift"

**Track**: Accuracy over time
**Adjust**: Calibrate confidence to match reality

**Goal**: Better calibrated predictions

---

## PART VIII: COMMON THINKING ERRORS

### The Rationalization Trap

**Process:**
1. Make decision emotionally
2. Construct logical-sounding reasons after
3. Believe you were rational all along

**Examples:**
- Buy expensive thing â†’ justify with "investment" logic
- Date wrong person â†’ "but they have potential"
- Ignore exercise â†’ "I'm too busy" (really: don't want to)

**Counter**: Decide important things through frameworks, not feelings

### The Narrative Fallacy

**Human Brains Love Stories:**
- Create coherent narratives from random events
- "Everything happens for a reason"
- Hindsight bias makes past seem inevitable

**Reality**: Life is random + decisions + luck

**Practice**: Notice when you're creating narratives

### Motivated Reasoning

**When stakes are high, reasoning suffers:**
- Defend political team regardless
- Justify relationship despite red flags
- Minimize health symptoms

**Counter**: "What would I think if this was someone else?"

---

## PART IX: DECISION-MAKING SYSTEMS

### The 10-10-10 Rule

**For any decision, ask:**
- How will I feel about this in 10 minutes?
- How will I feel about this in 10 months?
- How will I feel about this in 10 years?

**Example - Quitting Job:**
- 10 min: Relieved, scared
- 10 months: Better if had plan, worse if impulsive
- 10 years: Probably fine either way

**Insight**: Zooms out from immediate emotion

### Regret Minimization Framework (Jeff Bezos)

**Project yourself to age 80:**
"Will I regret not trying this?"

**If yes**: Do it (even if scary)
**If no**: Don't do it (even if comfortable)

**Use**: For major life decisions

### The Regret Matrix

```
           Try It      |    Don't Try It
          -------------|------------------
Success   | Great!     | Regret forever
          |            |
Failure   | Learn from | Never know what
          | experience | could have been
```

**In most cases**: Try it. Even failure teaches.

### Decision Journal

**Before major decisions, write:**
- Date and time
- Decision being made
- Options considered
- Evidence for each
- My prediction
- How I'm feeling
- Key uncertainties

**6-12 months later, review:**
- What actually happened?
- Was I right?
- What did I miss?
- What signals predicted outcome?
- How can I improve?

**Result**: Calibrated decision-making improves dramatically

## PART X: THE THINKING TOOLKIT

### Mental Models Library

**25 Most Useful Models:**

1. **First Principles**: Break down to fundamental truths
2. **Inversion**: Think backward (how to guarantee failure?)
3. **Second-Order Effects**: And then what happens?
4. **Pareto Principle**: 80% results from 20% effort
5. **Margin of Safety**: Build in error room
6. **Circle of Competence**: Know what you know/don't know
7. **Occam's Razor**: Simplest explanation usually correct
8. **Hanlon's Razor**: Don't attribute to malice what's explainable by stupidity
9. **Opportunity Cost**: Choosing X means not choosing Y
10. **Compounding**: Small changes over time = massive results

*(And 15 more - research mental models for complete list)*

### The Socratic Method

**Ask better questions:**
- "What do you mean by...?"
- "How did you come to that conclusion?"
- "What evidence would change your mind?"
- "What am I missing?"
- "What would have to be true for this to be wrong?"

**Use**: On yourself and in discussions

## FINAL THOUGHTS

Critical thinking is a skill, not an innate trait. Like any skill, it improves with deliberate practice.

**You will make mistakes. That's how you learn.**

The goal isn't perfectionâ€”it's calibration. Know what you know, know what you don't know, update when evidence changes.

### The Ultimate Meta-Skill

Critical thinking is the skill that improves all other skills:
- Better learning (evaluate sources)
- Better decisions (use frameworks)
- Better arguments (construct logically)
- Better beliefs (proportion to evidence)

**Start small:**
1. Question one assumption daily
2. Spot one fallacy daily
3. Make one decision with framework

**The examined life is worth living. Start examining.**
