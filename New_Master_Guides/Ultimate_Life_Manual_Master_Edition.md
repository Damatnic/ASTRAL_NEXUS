### Wilderness Survival

#### The Survival Mindset

**S.T.O.P.**:
- **S**top: Don't panic
- **T**hink: Assess situation
- **O**bserve: Gather information
- **P**lan: Make rational decisions

**Survival Priorities**:
1. Maintain positive attitude
2. First aid for injuries
3. Shelter from elements
4. Signaling for rescue
5. Water procurement
6. Fire building
7. Food gathering

#### Building Shelter

**Shelter Types by Environment**:

**Forest - Lean-To**:
1. Find strong horizontal branch or fallen tree
2. Lean branches at 45° angle against it
3. Layer smaller branches and debris
4. Add leaves, bark, or moss for insulation
5. Make thick enough to block wind and rain

**Open Terrain - Debris Hut**:
1. Create ridgepole (fallen branch, 9-10 feet)
2. Prop one end 3 feet off ground
3. Create rib cage of branches along sides
4. Cover with leaves, grass, debris (2+ feet thick)
5. Fill interior with dry leaves for insulation

**Snow - Snow Cave**:
1. Find deep snow drift
2. Dig entrance tunnel at base
3. Hollow out interior (dome shape)
4. Ventilation hole in ceiling essential!
5. Platform for sleeping above entrance level
6. Block entrance with backpack/snow block

**Desert - Shade Shelter**:
1. Dig pit 3-4 feet deep
2. Stretch tarp/cloth above pit
3. Anchor edges with rocks
4. Creates cooling shade space
5. Can bury yourself in sand (keep head out) if desperate

#### Fire Building

**Fire Triangle**: Needs oxygen, heat, fuel

**Materials**:
- **Tinder**: Catches spark easily (dry grass, bark, cotton, dryer lint)
- **Kindling**: Small twigs, dead branches (pencil-thick)
- **Fuel**: Larger logs and branches

**Fire Lay Methods**:

**Teepee** (best for starting):
1. Tinder bundle in center
2. Lean kindling in cone shape around it
3. Gradually add larger pieces
4. Light tinder from bottom/windward side

**Log Cabin** (long-burning):
1. Lay parallel logs with gap between
2. Add perpendicular layer on top
3. Continue alternating direction
4. Fill center with tinder and kindling
5. Light from center

**Ignition Methods**:

**Friction - Bow Drill** (difficult but reliable):
- Requires: spindle, fireboard, bow, handhold
- Creates friction heat → ember → fire
- Practice essential before needing it

**Flint and Steel**:
- Strike sharp edge (steel) against flint
- Creates sparks
- Aim sparks at char cloth or tinder

**Lens Method**:
- Magnifying glass, glasses, water bottle
- Focus sunlight into smallest point on tinder
- Requires bright sun

**Modern**:
- Waterproof matches
- Lighter (carry backup)
- Ferrocerium rod (excellent backup)

#### Water Procurement

**Finding Water**:

**Natural Sources**:
- Streams, rivers (moving water preferable)
- Lakes, ponds
- Rain collection
- Morning dew (wipe with cloth, wring out)
- Tree transpiration (bag over green branch)
- Follow animal tracks (lead to water)
- Low-lying areas, valley bottoms

**Water Collection**:
- Rainwater: Clean containers, tarps, ponchos
- Dew collection: Tie cloth to ankles, walk through grass at dawn, wring out
- Solar still: Dig hole, place container in center, cover with plastic, weight center, condensation drips down

**Purification Methods**:

**Boiling** (most reliable):
- Rolling boil for 1 minute (3 minutes above 6,500 ft)
- Kills all pathogens
- Doesn't remove chemicals or improve taste

**Chemical Treatment**:
- Iodine tablets: Follow instructions
- Chlorine dioxide (Aquatabs)
- Wait time required (usually 30 minutes)
- Doesn't work on all pathogens (Cryptosporidium resistant)

**Filtration**:
- Commercial filters (Sawyer, LifeStraw)
- Remove bacteria and protozoa
- Don't remove viruses (less concern in wilderness)
- Pre-filter through cloth to remove sediment

**UV Light** (SteriPEN):
- Disrupts DNA of microorganisms
- Fast (90 seconds)
- Requires batteries
- Water must be clear

**DIY Filter**:
- Layers in bottle: gravel, sand, charcoal, cloth
- Removes sediment and some chemicals
- Must still boil or chemically treat afterward

#### Food in Wilderness

**Foraging Rules**:
1. **Universal Edibility Test** (for unknown plants):
   - Test one part of one plant at a time
   - Rub on skin (wait 15 min for reaction)
   - Touch to lips (wait 3 min)
   - Touch to tongue (wait 15 min)
   - Chew and hold in mouth (wait 15 min)
   - Swallow small amount (wait 5 hours)
   - If no symptoms, eat 1/4 cup (wait 5 hours)
   - Still risky - prefer known edibles

2. **Avoid**:
   - Milky or discolored sap
   - Beans, bulbs, seeds inside pods
   - Bitter or soapy taste
   - Three-leaved plants
   - Mushrooms (unless expert identification)

**Commonly Edible Plants** (verify for your region):
- Dandelions (all parts edible)
- Cattails (roots, shoots, pollen)
- Acorns (must leach tannins)
- Pine needles (vitamin C tea)
- Clover
- Wild berries (proper identification critical!)

**Fishing**:
- Improvised hooks (thorns, carved wood)
- Line from shoelaces, plant fibers
- Bait: worms, insects
- Fish trap: rock enclosure at water edge

**Hunting/Trapping**:
- Snares for small game (requires knowledge and practice)
- Spears for larger prey
- Follow all legal and ethical guidelines

**Insects**:
- High protein source
- Avoid: Bright colors, hairy, strong odor
- Cook before eating
- Remove wings, legs
- Grasshoppers, crickets, ants (remove head), grubs

4. Read degree at index line

**Following a Bearing**:
1. Set desired degree at index line
2. Hold compass flat
3. Rotate body until red needle aligns with orienting arrow
4. Walk in direction of travel arrow
5. Check frequently

**Using Map and Compass Together**:
1. Orient map to north (align map north with compass north)
2. Place compass on map (edge connecting current location to destination)
3. Rotate bezel until orienting lines parallel map's north lines
4. Read bearing
5. Follow bearing in terrain

#### Natural Navigation

**Using the Sun**:
- Rises in east, sets in west (generally)
- In Northern Hemisphere: At noon, sun is due south
- Shadow-tip method:
  1. Place stick vertically in ground
  2. Mark shadow tip (this is west)
  3. Wait 15 minutes
  4. Mark new shadow tip (line between marks = west-east line)

**Using Stars** (Northern Hemisphere):
- Locate Big Dipper
- Find two stars at end of "cup"
- Follow line upward (5× distance)
- Bright star = Polaris (North Star)
- Polaris = true north

**Using Watch** (Northern Hemisphere):
- Point hour hand at sun
- Halfway between hour hand and 12 = south

**Natural Indicators**:
- Moss: Often grows on north side of trees (not always reliable)
- Anthill: Tends toward south side
- Tree rings: Generally wider on south side

### Signaling for Rescue

**Priority Signals**:

**Fire**:

- "→" = traveling this direction

**Mirror/Reflective**:
- Signal mirror (most effective)
- Any reflective surface
- Visible for miles
- Aim at aircraft/boat by:
  1. Make "V" with fingers
  2. Sight target through "V"
  3. Angle mirror so reflection flashes through "V"

**Whistle**:
- 3 blasts = distress signal
- Carries farther than voice
- Conserves energy

**Bright Colors**:
- Orange, red clothing visible
- Spread out in clearing
- Move to create motion

## PART II: FINANCIAL MASTERY

### Foundation Principles

**The Laws of Wealth**:
1. Spend less than you earn
2. Invest the difference
3. Avoid bad debt
4. Plan for the unexpected
5. Time in market beats timing the market

### Budgeting

#### The 50/30/20 Rule

**50% - Needs** (essentials):
- Housing (rent/mortgage)
- Utilities
- Groceries
- Transportation
- Insurance
- Minimum debt payments

**30% - Wants** (discretionary):
- Dining out
- Entertainment
- Hobbies
- Non-essential shopping
- Subscriptions

**20% - Savings & Debt**:
- Emergency fund
- Retirement savings
- Extra debt payments
- Investments
- Future goals

#### Creating Your Budget

**Step 1: Track Everything** (30 days):
- Every dollar spent
- Every source of income
- Use app (Mint, YNAB) or spreadsheet
- No judgment yet - just observe

**Step 2: Categorize**:
- Group similar expenses
- Separate fixed vs. variable
- Identify needs vs. wants
- Look for patterns

**Step 3: Set Targets**:
- Apply 50/30/20 rule (or customize)
- Set realistic category limits
- Build in buffer (5-10%)
- Account for irregular expenses (annual insurance, etc.)

**Step 4: Implement & Adjust**:
- Start new month with plan
- Track against budget
- Adjust as needed (first 3 months are trial period)
- Review monthly, revise quarterly

#### Reducing Expenses

**Big Three** (Housing, Transportation, Food):
- Together often 60-70% of expenses
- Small % reduction = big savings

**Housing** (30-35% of income max):
- Downsize if possible
- Get roommate
- Refinance mortgage
- Negotiate rent
- Move to lower cost area

**Transportation** (15-20% max):
- Buy used, not new
- Keep cars longer (10+ years)
- Consider one-car household
- Use public transit
- Bike/walk when possible

**Food** (10-15% max):
- Meal plan weekly
- Cook at home
- Buy generic brands
- Use grocery apps/coupons
- Reduce meat consumption (expensive)
- Limit restaurant meals

**Subscriptions & Memberships**:
- Audit everything monthly
- Cancel unused services
- Share accounts when allowed (Netflix, etc.)
- Choose annual vs. monthly (often cheaper)

### Debt Management

#### Good Debt vs. Bad Debt

**Good Debt** (invests in future):
- Mortgage (appreciating asset)
- Student loans (increased earning potential)
- Business loan (generates income)
- Characteristics: Low interest, tax-deductible, invests in value

**Bad Debt** (depreciating, high interest):
- Credit card debt (high interest)
- Auto loans on depreciating vehicles
- Personal loans for consumption
- Payday loans (predatory - avoid at all costs!)

#### Debt Payoff Strategies

**Step 1: Stop Creating New Debt**
- Cut up credit cards if needed
- Switch to debit/cash
- Break spending cycle

**Step 2: List All Debts**:
- Creditor name
- Total balance
- Interest rate
- Minimum payment

**Step 3: Choose Strategy**:

**Debt Avalanche** (mathematically optimal):
1. Pay minimums on all debts
2. Put extra toward highest interest rate
3. Once paid, roll payment to next highest rate
4. Repeat until debt-free
5. Saves most money overall

**Debt Snowball** (psychologically effective):
1. Pay minimums on all debts
2. Put extra toward smallest balance
3. Once paid, roll payment to next smallest
4. Quick wins provide motivation
5. May cost slightly more in interest

**Step 4: Find Extra Money**:
- Temporarily reduce wants to 0-10%
- Side hustles
- Sell unused items
- Use windfalls (tax refunds, bonuses)

**Step 5: Negotiate**:
- Call creditors
- Ask for lower interest rates
- Request hardship programs
- Consider balance transfers (if disciplined)

### Emergency Fund

**Target Amount**:
- Starter: $1,000 (while paying debt)
- Full: 3-6 months expenses
- Self-employed: 6-12 months

**Where to Keep It**:
- High-yield savings account (accessible)
- Money market account
- NOT invested (needs to be stable/liquid)
- Separate from checking (avoid temptation)

**Building It**:
1. Start with any amount
2. Automate transfers (every paycheck)
3. Add windfalls
4. Consider it a bill (non-negotiable)

**Using It**:
- True emergencies only (job loss, medical, urgent repairs)
- NOT for: Christmas, known expenses, wants
- Replenish immediately after use

### Retirement Savings

#### Why Start Young

**Time = Money** (compound interest):
- $5,000/year from age 25-65 @ 7% = $1,068,047
- $5,000/year from age 35-65 @ 7% = $505,365
- Starting 10 years earlier = 2× the result!

#### Retirement Account Types

**401(k) / 403(b)** (Employer plans):
- **Contribution**: $23,000/year (2024, under 50)
- **Employer match**: Free money - always take full match!
- **Tax treatment**: Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax)
- **Pros**: High limits, often matching, automatic
- **Cons**: Limited investment options, penalties for early withdrawal

**Traditional IRA**:
- **Contribution**: $7,000/year (2024, under 50)
- **Tax treatment**: Tax-deductible now, taxed in retirement
- **Pros**: More investment options, tax deduction
- **Cons**: Income limits for deduction, required minimum distributions

**Roth IRA**:
- **Contribution**: $7,000/year (2024, under 50)
- **Tax treatment**: After-tax contributions, tax-free growth & withdrawals
- **Pros**: Tax-free retirement income, no RMDs, can withdraw contributions anytime
- **Cons**: Income limits, no immediate tax benefit
- **Best for**: Young people, those expecting higher future tax rates

#### Retirement Savings Strategy

**Priority Order**:
1. **Contribute to 401(k) up to match** (free money!)
2. **Pay off high-interest debt** (>7-8% interest)
3. **Max Roth IRA** ($7,000/year)
4. **Max 401(k)** ($23,000/year total)
5. **Taxable investment accounts** (if maxed above)

**How Much to Save**:
- Minimum: 15% of gross income
- Including employer match
- Earlier start = lower % needed
- Goal: Replace 70-80% of pre-retirement income

### Investing Basics

#### Investment Types

**Stocks**:
- Ownership in companies
- Higher risk, higher return potential
- Long-term average: ~10% annually
- Volatile short-term
- Best for long time horizons (10+ years)

**Bonds**:
- Loans to companies/governments
- Lower risk, lower return
- More stable than stocks
- Income through interest
- Buffer against stock volatility

**Index Funds/ETFs**:
- Baskets of many stocks/bonds
- Low cost (expense ratios <0.1%)
- Instant diversification
- Passive management
- **Recommended for most people**

**Target-Date Funds**:
- Automatically adjust risk over time
- Start aggressive (mostly stocks) when young
- Gradually shift to conservative (more bonds) as target date approaches
- Simple, hands-off option
- Slightly higher fees than index funds

**Real Estate**:
- Physical property or REITs
- Can provide income and appreciation
- Less liquid than stocks/bonds
- Requires more capital and knowledge

#### Investing Strategy for Beginners

**Simple 3-Fund Portfolio**:

1. **Total US Stock Market** (60%)
   - Example: VTSAX (Vanguard), FSKAX (Fidelity)
   - Entire US stock market

2. **Total International Stock Market** (30%)
   - Example: VTIAX (Vanguard), FTIHX (Fidelity)
   - Diversification outside US

3. **Total Bond Market** (10%)
   - Example: VBTLX (Vanguard), FXNAX (Fidelity)
   - Stability and income

**Adjust** by age:
- 20s-30s: 90% stocks / 10% bonds
- 40s: 80% stocks / 20% bonds
- 50s: 70% stocks / 30% bonds
- 60s+: 60% stocks / 40% bonds

**Alternative**: Target-date fund matching your retirement year

#### Investment Principles

**1. Start Early**: Time is your biggest asset

**2. Invest Consistently**: Dollar-cost averaging
- Same amount every month
- Automate it
- Removes emotion
- Averages out market volatility

**3. Diversify**: Don't put all eggs in one basket
- Across asset types (stocks/bonds)
- Across companies (index funds)
- Across geographies (international)

**4. Keep Costs Low**:
- Expense ratios <0.2%
- Avoid frequent trading (taxes/fees)
- Avoid actively managed funds (rarely beat index)

**5. Think Long-Term**:
- Don't check daily
- Don't panic sell in downturns
- Stay the course
- Time in market > timing market

**6. Rebalance Annually**:
- Restore target percentages
- Sells winners, buys losers
- Maintains risk level

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake**: Keeping too much cash
**Solution**: Invest for long-term goals (cash loses to inflation)

**Mistake**: Trying to time the market
**Solution**: Invest consistently regardless of market conditions

**Mistake**: Following hot stock tips
**Solution**: Stick with diversified index funds

**Mistake**: Panic selling in downturns
**Solution**: Remember long-term plan, downturns are buying opportunities

- Noticed something concerning
- Evaluating situation
- Preparing potential response
- Not acting yet, but ready

**Condition Red** (Action Required):

- Fight, flight, or compliance

#### Developing Awareness

**General Practices**:
- Look up from phone regularly
- Take out one earbud (or none in risky areas)
- Scan environment periodically
- Trust your instincts (if something feels off, it probably is)
- Notice exits wherever you go
- Observe people (body language, behavior)
- Be aware of "normal" for the environment

**Specific Situations**:

**Walking**:
- Head up, purposeful stride
- Vary routine/routes
- Well-lit, populated areas
- Walk against traffic (can't be followed by car)
- Keys ready before reaching car/home

**Public Transit**:

### De-Escalation

#### When Someone Is Aggressive

**Do**:
- Stay calm (don't match their energy)
- Speak slowly, quietly
- Give them space (2+ arm lengths)
- Show open hands (non-threatening)
- Acknowledge their feelings ("I see you're upset")
- Offer solutions if appropriate
- Create exit opportunity

**Don't**:
- Touch them
- Invade their space

- Yell or argue
- Be condescending
- Challenge their ego
- Block their exit

**If De-Escalation Fails**:
- Your safety is priority
- Leave if possible
- Call for help (911)
- Defend yourself if necessary

### Basic Self-Defense

#### Principles

**1. Awareness is Best Defense**: Avoid situations if possible

**2. Your Goal**: Escape, not "win fight"

**3. Targets** (if you must strike):
- Eyes (jab with fingers)
- Nose (palm strike)
- Throat (chop or grab)
- Groin (kick or knee)
- Knee (stomp or kick from side)

**4. Create Opportunity to Escape**:
- Strike → Create space → Run → Call for help
- Don't stay to fight if escape is possible

**5. Use Your Voice**:
- Scream/yell to attract attention
- Command voice: "BACK OFF!" "NO!"

#### Basic Techniques

**If Grabbed from Front**:
- React immediately (harder to escape once controlled)
- Strike vulnerable areas
- Create space
- Run

**If Grabbed from Behind (Bear hug)**:
- Drop weight, bend forward
- Strike back with elbow
- Stomp on instep
- Throw head back into their face
- Drop and slip out as they loosen grip

**If Pushed Against Wall**:
- Protect head
- Strike (palm heel to nose/chin)
- Push off wall forcefully
- Knee to groin
- Escape

**If Knocked Down**:
- Don't stay down
- Kick at knees if they approach
- Get up and run immediately

**If Choked** (hands around throat):
- Tuck chin to protect airway
- Pluck their thumb off (weakest point)
- Strike vulnerable areas
- Move away immediately

#### After an Attack

**Immediate**:
- Get to safety
- Call police (911)
- Seek medical attention (even if injuries seem minor)
- Don't shower/change clothes (preserves evidence)

**Follow-Up**:
- Report to police (your choice)
- Document everything (injuries, details, costs)
- Seek counseling (trauma is real)
- Inform trusted friends/family
- Safety plan going forward

### Home Security

#### Physical Security

**Doors**:
- Solid core or metal
- Deadbolts (Grade 1 or 2)
- Strike plates with 3" screws
- Peephole or camera
- Lock even when home

**Windows**:
- Locks on all windows
- Security film or bars (ground floor)
- Lock even when home
- Motion sensor lights outside

**Lighting**:
- Motion-sensor lights (all sides)
- Well-lit entry points
- Timers when away (look occupied)

**Visibility**:
- Trim bushes near windows/doors
- Security cameras (visible = deterrent)
- Neighborhood watch participation

#### Operational Security

**Deliveries**:

### Cyber Security

#### Password Security

**Good Passwords**:
- Long (12+ characters)
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Unique for each account (don't reuse)
- Not dictionary words
- Not personal info (birthday, names)

**Use Password Manager**:
- Remembers all passwords
- Generates strong passwords
- Only remember one master password
- Options: Bitwarden, 1Password, LastPass

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:
- Enable on all important accounts
- Requires: password + code from phone
- Much more secure
- Use authenticator app (not SMS if possible)

#### Online Safety

**Email**:
- Don't click links in unexpected emails
- Verify sender before clicking/downloading
- Watch for phishing (looks official but isn't)
- Don't give personal info via email

**Social Media**:

## PART VIII: TIME MANAGEMENT & PRODUCTIVITY

### Understanding Time Management

#### Common Time Wasters

- Social media scrolling
- Unnecessary meetings
- Disorganization (looking for things)
- Procrastination
- Poor planning
- Interruptions
- Perfectionism
- Lack of priorities

#### Myths About Productivity

**Myth**: Busy = Productive
**Reality**: Activity ≠ Achievement. Focus on results, not hours.

**Myth**: Multitasking is efficient
**Reality**: Task-switching reduces efficiency. Focus on one thing at a time.

**Myth**: Longer hours = More output
**Reality**: Fatigue reduces quality and efficiency. Rest is productive.

**Myth**: You need to do everything
**Reality**: Saying no is essential. You can't do it all.

### Priority Management

#### Eisenhower Matrix

Categorize tasks by Urgent vs. Important:

**Quadrant 1: Urgent AND Important** (Do First):
- Crises and emergencies
- Deadlines
- Critical problems
- **Action**: Do immediately

**Quadrant 2: Important but NOT Urgent** (Schedule):
- Planning and preparation
- Relationship building
- Learning and development
- Exercise and self-care
- **Action**: Schedule time for these (most valuable quadrant!)

**Quadrant 3: Urgent but NOT Important** (Delegate):
- Interruptions
- Some emails/calls
- Others' priorities
- Busy work
- **Action**: Delegate if possible, minimize

**Quadrant 4: Neither Urgent NOR Important** (Eliminate):
- Time wasters
- Mindless scrolling
- Excessive TV
- Trivia
- **Action**: Eliminate ruthlessly

**Goal**: Spend most time in Quadrant 2

#### Daily Priority System

**Each Day**:
1. **List all tasks** for the day
2. **Identify "MIT"** (Most Important Tasks) - 1-3 tasks that MUST get done
3. **Do MITs first** (when energy is highest)
4. **Everything else** is bonus

**Question**: "If I only accomplish one thing today, what should it be?"

### Planning Systems

#### Weekly Planning (Sunday Evening or Monday Morning)

**Review**:
- Last week's accomplishments
- What went well, what didn't
- Lessons learned

**Plan**:
- Key goals for upcoming week
- Major events/appointments
- Identify priorities
- Schedule deep work time

**Prepare**:
- Meal plan and prep
- Lay out clothes
- Review calendar
- Reduce decision fatigue

#### Daily Planning (End of each day or morning)

**Review**:
- What got accomplished
- What didn't (why?)
- Adjust tomorrow's plan

**Plan Tomorrow**:
- List all tasks
- Identify 1-3 MITs
- Time block if helpful
- Prepare what's needed

**Benefits**:
- Hit ground running
- Clear priorities
- Less stress
- More accomplished

### Time Blocking

#### The Method

Instead of to-do list, schedule everything:

**Example Day**:
- 6:00-7:00: Morning routine
- 7:00-8:00: Deep work (MIT #1)
- 8:00-8:30: Email check
- 8:30-10:00: Deep work (MIT #2)
- 10:00-10:15: Break
- 10:15-11:30: Meetings
- 11:30-12:00: Email/admin
- 12:00-1:00: Lunch + walk
- 1:00-3:00: Deep work (MIT #3)
- 3:00-3:15: Break
- 3:15-4:30: Shallow work (emails, calls)
- 4:30-5:00: Plan tomorrow, wrap up
- 5:00-10:00: Personal time

#### Tips for Success

**Themes by Day**:
- Monday: Planning and meetings
- Tuesday/Wednesday: Deep work
- Thursday: Collaboration
- Friday: Wrap up and learning

**Protect Deep Work**:
- Schedule most important work first
- No meetings during deep work time
- Minimize distractions
- Batch similar tasks

**Buffer Time**:
- Don't pack schedule completely
- 50% rule: only schedule 4 hours of hard work in 8-hour day
- Rest of time for: overflow, interruptions, unexpected, breaks

**Batch Tasks**:
- Email: Check 2-3× daily, not constantly
- Errands: One trip, not multiple
- Similar tasks together (reduces switching cost)

### Managing Energy

#### Identify Your Peak Times

- When are you most alert?
- When do you drag?
- Schedule important work during peak times
- Save easy tasks for low energy

**Common Patterns**:
- Morning people: Peak 8 AM - Noon
- Evening people: Peak 4 PM - 10 PM
- Most people: Mid-morning dip, post-lunch dip, evening rally

#### Energy Management

**Physical Energy**:
- Sleep well (7-9 hours)
- Eat regular, healthy meals
- Exercise regularly
- Take breaks
- Hydrate

**Mental Energy**:
- Single-task (no multitasking)
- Break projects into smaller pieces
- Pomodoro technique (25 min work / 5 min break)
- Vary types of work
- Avoid decision fatigue (routine/systems)

**Emotional Energy**:
- Do work you find meaningful
- Celebrate wins
- Positive social interactions
- Manage stress
- Set boundaries

**Recovery**:
- Daily: Breaks, evening wind-down
- Weekly: Day off, leisureactivities
- Annually: Vacation (real disconnect)

### Overcoming Procrastination

#### Why We Procrastinate

- Task seems overwhelming
- Unclear how to start
- Fear of failure (or success)
- Lack of motivation/interest
- Perfectionism
- Lack of immediate consequence

#### Solutions

**Make It Smaller**:
- Break into tiny first step
- "Just 5 minutes"
- Lower the barrier

**Make It Clear**:
- Define specific next action
- "Draft outline" not "work on project"

**Make It Scheduled**:
- Specific time on calendar
- Removes decision of "when"

**Make It Rewarding**:
- Build in reward after completion
- Or make process enjoyable (good music, coffee, etc.)

**Remove Obstacles**:
- Eliminate distractions
- Prepare materials in advance
- Remove friction

**Use Commitment Device**:
- Tell someone you'll do it
- Schedule accountability check-in
- Public commitment

**Just Start** (Most Effective):
- Action precedes motivation (not the other way around)
- Starting is hardest part
- Momentum builds
- "5-minute rule": commit to just 5 minutes, usually keep going

### Saying No

#### Why It's Hard

- Want to be helpful
- Fear of disappointing
- FOMO (fear of missing out)
- Unclear priorities

#### Why It's Essential

- You can't do everything
- Every "yes" is a "no" to something else
- Your time and energy are finite
- Protecting your priorities

#### How to Say No

**Direct**:
- "I can't take that on right now."
- "That doesn't fit my priorities."
- Don't over-explain

**Offer Alternative**:
- "I can't, but have you asked [person]?"
- "Not now, but I could in [month]."

**Buy Time**:
- "Let me check my schedule and get back to you."
- Gives time to consider if you want to

**Remember**:
- "No" is a complete sentence
- Don't feel guilty for having boundaries
- The people who matter will understand
