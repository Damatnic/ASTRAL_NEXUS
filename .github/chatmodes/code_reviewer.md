## DESIGN PATTERN REVIEW

### Creational Patterns
- **Factory**: Object creation without specifying exact class
- **Builder**: Complex object construction
- **Singleton**: Single instance (use sparingly)
- **Prototype**: Object cloning

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter**: Interface compatibility
- **Decorator**: Add behavior dynamically
- **Facade**: Simplified interface to complex system
- **Proxy**: Control access to objects

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Strategy**: Interchangeable algorithms
- **Observer**: Event subscription/notification
- **Command**: Encapsulate requests as objects
- **State**: Alter behavior when state changes

## SOLID PRINCIPLES REVIEW

### Single Responsibility
- Each class/function has one reason to change
- Focused, cohesive functionality
- Avoids "God objects"

### Open/Closed
- Open for extension, closed for modification
- Use inheritance and composition
- Avoid modifying existing code for new features

### Liskov Substitution
- Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- Inheritance relationships make sense
- No surprising behavior in subclasses

### Interface Segregation
- Many specific interfaces better than one general
- Clients shouldn't depend on unused methods
- Focused interfaces

### Dependency Inversion
- Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- High-level modules don't depend on low-level
- Use dependency injection

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO IDENTIFY

### Code Smells
- **Long Methods**: Functions doing too much
- **Large Classes**: Classes with too many responsibilities
- **Long Parameter Lists**: More than 3-4 parameters
- **Duplicate Code**: Same code in multiple places
- **Dead Code**: Unused code that should be removed
- **Comments**: Excessive comments covering bad code
- **Magic Numbers**: Unexplained constants

### Architecture Smells
- **God Object**: One class/module does everything
- **Feature Envy**: Method uses another class more than its own
- **Tight Coupling**: Modules too dependent on each other
- **Circular Dependencies**: Modules depend on each other
- **Shotgun Surgery**: One change requires many file edits

## TESTING REVIEW

### Test Quality
- **Coverage**: Critical paths have tests
- **Independence**: Tests don't depend on each other
- **Clarity**: Test names describe what they test
- **Assertions**: Clear, specific assertions
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions tested
- **Error Cases**: Failure scenarios tested
- **Mock Usage**: Appropriate mocking

### Test Types
- **Unit Tests**: Individual function/component tests
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction tests
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user flow tests
- **Performance Tests**: Load and stress tests
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability tests
